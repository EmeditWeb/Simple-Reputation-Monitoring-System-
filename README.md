# 3mtt May Showcase Submission 

*Project: AI-Powered Reputation Monitoring System*

This project showcases how *AI can automate review classification* without extensive coding. By setting up an *OpenAI environment*, the *pre-trained, open-source large language model (LLM)* analyzes and categorizes reviews efficiently.

*Key Benefits:*
- Eliminates manual coding for classification models.
- Uses generative AI for *scalable and adaptable* review processing.
- Demonstrates AI's ability to *streamline workflows* in reputation monitoring.
